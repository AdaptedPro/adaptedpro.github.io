<p>It all starts with a brand. An overused word, but still. It&rsquo;s your story, your purpose, your personal
distinction, whether you&rsquo;re a small business or a big corporation.</p>

<p>Sometimes your brand is already established. Sometimes it&rsquo;s inconsistent or needs to be refreshed.
And sometimes it needs to be clearly defined right from the start.</p>

<p>From there, the best way to tell your story, what to focus on and the elements you need to be convincing
are all part of content development. For example, sometimes it&rsquo;s an entire creative campaign.
Or a website. Or a brochure. Or a brochure and a website. Or even an online application that allows
your organization to self-generate internal web pages in a consistent way.</p>

<p>Once the content has been determined, the next step is to write about, design, program, film or print
it. But these elements do not just come together. Much like the musicians in an orchestra, no matter
how talented, you still need a conductor or director to bring them together.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I do. Start with the brand, develop the content, then work with a talented team to make
sure it all comes together seamlessly.</p>
