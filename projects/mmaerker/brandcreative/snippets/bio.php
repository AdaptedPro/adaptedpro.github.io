<p>I love to tell stories. I started telling stories with handmade books, drawings, puppets shows,
whatever I could do, which continued through college, where I graduated from Columbia
University, and then as a recipient of a James Michener Fellowship in Screenwriting.</p>
<p>Words and images always go together in my mind. So it was not surprising when I co-founded
a boutique creative firm, Beyondform, with a designer partner. For over ten years, we got to
work with some pretty amazing clients, large and small, product- and service-oriented. And
working across industries kept things interesting and gave our clients a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>Now I get to do the same thing, but with an expandable team. I help position brands, develop
content, sometimes write, and mostly, direct a talented group of creative professionals.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I love my job and doing a great job for my clients.</p>
